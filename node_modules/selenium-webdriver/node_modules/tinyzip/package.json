Also it doesn't depend on any non standard\nnative liberaries, pure Node.Js > 0.6.X.\n\nModule usage follows this scenario:\n\n```\nfunction(req, res, next){\n\tvar paths, rootpath;\n\t...\n\t// Somehow putting file paths into paths array and rootpath\n\t...\n\tvar fname = req.query.project+\"-\"+req.query.type+\"-\"+req.query.path;\n\tvar head={'Content-Type':'application/octet-stream','Content-disposition':'attachment; filename='+fname,'Transfer-Encoding':'chunked' }\n\tres.writeHead(200,head)\t\t\t\n\tvar zip = new TinyZip({rootpath:rootpath});\n\t_(paths).forEach(function (file) {\n\t\tzip.addFile({file:file,compress:false})\n\t})\n\tvar zipStream = zip.getZipStream();\n\tzipStream.pipe(res);\n}\n```\n## API\n\n### Constructor - TinyZip(options)\nConstrouct new ZipFile object, accept global options that will be available for all files\n\n### addFile(options)\nAdd file into archive. **options** can have following attributes:\n\n* **file** - path to file\n* **utf8** - true/false, when true force usage of utf8 for file names\n* **fast** - true/false, force usage zip file option to not put stream info in trailer which allows to stream compression of file reading. When false each file inside archive will be fetched into memory and compressed also as single block\n* **compress** - false/deflate_options_obj, for example set the maximum compression {level:9}\n* **rootpath** - false/somepath, when not false used to build relative names inside archive. \n\n## getZipStream\nReturn Read stream\n\n## MIT License\n\nCopyright (c) [PushOk Software](http://www.pushok.com)\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
